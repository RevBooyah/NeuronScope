# NeuronScope Prompt Templates for Cursor

These prompts are designed to be copy/paste-friendly inside Cursor when working on specific features.

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualization

**Static Heatmap**
> Create a React component that displays a heatmap of neuron activations from a JSON file. Each row should represent a neuron, each column a token. Use Plotly or a performant D3 alternative.

**Neuron Clustering Scatter Plot**
> Build a Python function that reduces high-dimensional neuron activations (e.g., 768-dim) using PCA or t-SNE and plots them with matplotlib or Plotly. Group points by cluster ID with color.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Interaction

**Activation Extraction**
> Write a Python function that takes a string prompt and returns the hidden states for all layers and all neurons in GPT-2.

**Top Token Activation Query**
> Write a function that returns the top N tokens that cause the highest activation for a given neuron across a list of prompts.

---

## ðŸ”„ CLI Tooling

**Batch Activation Processor**
> Create a CLI tool in Python that takes a list of prompts, runs GPT-2 on each, and outputs their neuron activation JSON files.

**Cluster Automation**
> Write a CLI script that loads activation JSON files, performs clustering per layer using KMeans, and writes the results to `clusters/`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Frontend Glue

**Data Loader for Plotly Heatmap**
> Write a React hook that loads a local JSON file containing neuron activations and returns formatted data suitable for Plotly heatmap display.

**Dropdown for Prompt Selection**
> Create a React component that renders a dropdown from `samples.json` and updates the current prompt selection.

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Data

**Synthetic Activation Generator**
> Create a Python script that generates random activation data in the same format as the real output, for UI testing.

These prompt patterns help keep Cursor focused and reusable. Add new ones as needed.
